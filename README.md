# Bank Note Authenticator

# UCI dataset:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication

# My Approch:
It is a classification problem statement. so I tried different Machine Learning Algorithm such as Support Vector Machine Classifier, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour, Na√Øve Bayes classifier, K-means Clustering. Among them, Random forest classifier gives me best accuracy. My goal is to create end-to-end Machine Learning Pipeline and deploy it using docker through Heroku platform.
